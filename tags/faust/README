Hi

For the completness,

These are the faust source files I use to build the dsp unit's I use in guitarix.
Mostly I rework the resulting C++ files to stick the units together like you found them in guitarix.

Please note that not all parts guitarix use are build with the faust compiler.
As you can find the guitarix source now, the dsp part (gx_engine_audio.cpp) is a heavy mix from faust source and plain C++ , also the rest is high level reworked first by me, and now by James Warden. 

So guitarix comes now in a objekt orientatet version, and will change the source style a bit more, anyway, it based on the fantastic faust compiler,  so without faust, there wouldn't be a guitarix project.
