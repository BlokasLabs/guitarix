This is the zita rev1 reverb as a demo plugin
for guitarix.

zita rev1 is included in faust 0.9.43. Since
we are using 0.9.30 at the moment, I temporarily
copied math.lib from 0.9.43 and put some definitions
from filter.lib and effect.lib into zita_rev1.dsp.

With 0.9.43 it would be just one line...

Start guitarix with this command line

$ guitarix -P <..path to this dir..>

The Zita Rev1 plugin should appear in the last
position in the effect list.
