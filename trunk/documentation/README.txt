To generate documentation please start doxygen in this directory.
There is only sparse documentation in the sources, so you will get
mostly structural information generated by doxygen.

set HAVE_DOT to NO in Doxyfile if you don't have graphviz installed
(or if you don't need the pretty graphs and want to accelerate the
doxygen pass).

To view the generated documentaion, use a browser on html/index.html.
