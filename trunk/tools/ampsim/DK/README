Warning: experimental/unfinished code, missing documentation...

This directory contains an analog electronic circuit simulator, like
e.g. Spice but with an emphasis on execution speed. It uses the
"DK method" and generates/compiles optimized C++ code internally for
signal calculations.

The simulated circuit is defined by a "netlist", which is easy to
write manually. Circuit schematics can also be drawn with gschem (part
of gEDA), then a netlist can be extraced with mk_netlist.py.

TODO: the produced code gets real-time execution speed for simple
circuits, but for complex circuits the solver for nonlinear equations
needs to be replaced (by function appromixation tables etc.).

Dependencies:
 - python-scipy
 - python-matplotlib  
 - python-sympy
 - for internally generated C++ module:
   - libeigen3-dev
   - libcminpack-dev

Demo:

"python circ.py", then select e.g. 5 (PushPullTransformer). You can
disable C code generation by adding option -p (the calculation will be
about a factor of 100 slower).
