Hello, 

guitarix,

guitarix is a simple mono amplifier to jack (JackAudioConnektionKit) with one input and
two output's. Designed to get nice trash/metall/rock/blues/guitar sounds. Avaliable are
the controls for bass, treble, gain, compressor, preamp, balance, distortion, freeverb, crybaby(wah)
and echo . A fixed resonator will use, when distortion is disable. For the 'presure' in the
sound you can use the feedback and feedforward sliders.

guitarix include a experimental tuner and a jack midi output port with 3 channels. They will
feed by a mix from a pitch tracker and a beat detector. You can choose for very channel
the midi channel, the program, the velocity, you can pich the okatve (2 up or down), and
you can choose the sensity, that meen how fast the note will read after the beat
detector have emit a signal. You can set the values for the beat detector for all channels.

Guitarix will use autoconnect. There for it use the environment variables: 

	  GUITARIX2JACK_INPUTS
	  GUITARIX2JACK_OUTPUTS

useage:
	  export GUITARIX2JACK_INPUTS=system:capture_1
	  export GUITARIX2JACK_OUTPUTS1=system:playback_1
	  export GUITARIX2JACK_OUTPUTS2=system:playback_2

If you dont use this variables guitarix will use this default settings. If you set them blank,
guitarix dont use autoconnect. 

Guitarix used a gtk.rc file to pimp the window, you can set your own gtk.rc file with:

         [--rcset] or [-r]  ->use the given path/name of gtk.rc file with guitarix.
                            
         guitarix -r /home/my/rcstyle

If you dont use this variable guitarix will use this default settings. If you set --clear or -c 
guitarix dont use a gtk.rc file and will use the settings from your windowmanager.

For easy useage you will find the script set_env_guitarix.sh in the source tree. You can
set the environment variables in the script and start guitarix with it.

Guitarix comes with a GTK Interface and as Ladspa plugin.

RECOMMENDS:

For capture guitarix make use of jack_capture from Kjetil S. Matheussen. If you dont have
it installed, look here:

			http://old.notam02.no/arkiv/src/?M=D

You dont need jack_capture to run guitarix, but the capture button wont work without
jack_capture and you get a warning when ever you push that button. guitarix only look in 
/usr/bin and /usr/local/bin for jack_capture. 
Record will allways go to ~/.guitarix/session.ogg
If you wont to save a session, rename or remove this file befor you record your next
session.
You also need vorbis-tools for encode to ogg:

			http://vorbistools.sourceforge.net/

For impulse response it use jconv by  Fons Adriaensen 

                   http://www.kokkinizita.net/linuxaudio/index.html 

You can choose the sets from some limited options for jconv with a setup widget and
start/stop jconv. The jconv settings will be saved together with the preset-settings from
guitarix. 
guitarix will check the ir.wav file for white space in the filename and remove them if
there are. Also you can resample the file to your used jack sample rate.
The rest is the same like with jack_capture, you dont need jconv to run/build guitarix, but . . . 

NEEDED:

You need Gtk+-dev, libsndfile1-dev and libjack-dev to build guitarix.
To build guitarix and guitarix.so simply run "make". If you can't run sse code, you must
use "make nosse". 

INSTALL:

It`s not nessesary to install guitarix, but you can. To run guitarix from the sourcetree
please use the set_env_guitarix.sh script.

Per default guitarix will install in /usr . If you wish to install it elsewhare (/usr/local)
please edit the PREFIX in the Makefile to your need's

Please make sure you have the environment variable $LADSPA_PATH is set, and 
if you install guitarix as root, you properly need to export this variable to make it
avaliable for root or edit the makefile prefix LADSPAPATH =

To build a debian paket run "dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b"



I use faust to build the prototype and will say thanks to contributors:
