Hello, 

Thanks for download guitarix,

guitarix is a simple mono amplifier to jack (JackAudioConnektionKit) with one input and two output's. Designed to get nice trash/metall/rock/guitar sounds. Avaliable are the controls for bass, treble, gain, preamp, balance, distortion, freeverb, crybaby(wah) and echo . A fixed resonator will use, when distortion is disable. For the 'presure' in the sound you can use the feedback and feedforward sliders.

You can start and stop the engine over the GUI menu. It's posible to save and load 6 presets, and guitarix will always start with the last used settings.

You can also start guitarix with no GUI, simply add the parameter 'nogui' to the comandline. The audio tread will start and you can, if you wont, start the GUI with enter 'g', and quit the GUI over the GUI menu. To quit the audio tread enter 'q' in the comandline.

Guitarix will use autoconnect. There for it use the environment variables: 

	  GUITARIX2JACK_INPUTS
	  GUITARIX2JACK_OUTPUTS

useage:
	  export GUITARIX2JACK_INPUTS=system:capture_1
	  export GUITARIX2JACK_OUTPUTS1=system:playback_1
	  export GUITARIX2JACK_OUTPUTS2=system:playback_2

If you dont use this variables guitarix will use this default settings. If you set them blank, guitarix dont use autoconnect. 

Guitarix used a gtk.rc file to pimp the window, you can set your own gtk.rc file with:

         [--rcset] or [-r]  ->use the given path/name of gtk.rc file with guitarix.
                            
         guitarix -r /home/my/rcstyle

If you dont use this variable guitarix will use this default settings. If you set --clear or -c  guitarix dont use a gtk.rc file and will use the settings from your windowmanager.

For easy useage you will find the script set_env_guitarix.sh in the source tree. You can set the environment variables in the script and start guitarix with it.

Guitarix comes with a GTK Interface and as Ladspa plugin.

I use faust to build the prototype and will say thanks to contributors:

RECOMMENDS:

For capture guitarix make use of jack_capture from Kjetil S. Matheussen. If you dont have it installed, look here:

			http://old.notam02.no/arkiv/src/?M=D

You dont need jack_capture to run guitarix, but the capture button wont work without jack_capture and you get a warning when ever you push that button. guitarix only look in /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin for jack_capture. Record will allways go to ~/.guitarix/session.ogg
If you wont to save a session, rename or remove this file befor you record your next session.
You also need vorbis-tools for encode to ogg:

			http://vorbistools.sourceforge.net/

For impulse response it use jconv by  Fons Adriaensen 

                   http://www.kokkinizita.net/linuxaudio/index.html 

You can choose the sets from some limited options for jconv with a setup widget and start/stop jconv. The jconv settings will be saved together with the preset-settings from guitarix. 
It's the same like with jack_capture, you dont need jconv to run/build guitarix, but . . . 

NEEDED:

You need Gtk+ and libjack-dev to build guitarix.
To build guitarix and guitarix.so simply run "make". If you can't run sse code, you must use "make nosse". 

It`s not nessesary to install guitarix, but you can. To run guitarix from the sourcetree please use the set_env_guitarix.sh script.

Per default guitarix will install in /usr . If you wish to install it elsewhare (/usr/local) please edit the PREFIX in the Makefile to your need's

To build a debian paket run "dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b"
debian paket will build without sse suport, you can change that in debian/rules.





enjoy
